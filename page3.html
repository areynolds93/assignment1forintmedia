<p>Why are you calling me on the phone Why are you not at home on time? You say you're staying over you're friend's because you've got a lot on your mind. Now you're swearing up and down that it ain't me but you still say that things have changed. So tell me what exactly does it mean when you say you need your space?</p>

<p>Just don't make no excuses, no no. Why you gotta lie to me? Just be a man about it! You don't gotta lie to me. Just be a man about it! If you wanna leave, go on. Just be a man about it! Come and grab your things and go on right now. Just be a man about it!</p>
