		<h2>He Wasn't Man Enough</h2>
<p>Listen girl who do you think I am? 
Don't you know that he was my man?
But I chose to let him go so why do you act like I still care about him?
Looking at me like I'm Hurt When I'm the one who said I didn't want it work. Don't you forget I had him first?</p>

<p>What were you thinkin'? He's not playing me He wasn't man enough for me. If you don't know now here's your chance. I've already had your man. But I chose to let him go. So why do you act like I still care about him? Looking at me like I'm hurt. When I'm the one who said I didn't wan't it to work. Don't you forget I had him first?</p>
