		<h2>Never Just For A Ring</h2>
<p>Explain to me, honestly who is she? Tell me you don't love this girl. Damn it boy, why'd you go and ruin everything that I've been living for? Is this where I'm suppose to turn my back, cry a tear and walk away. Before I do, a word to you, you should know...you've made a big mistake.</p>

<p>Why? Where? When? How? Who? What made you go off and do this crazy thing? I thought I loved you good, loved you all I could. Never Just for a Ring.</p>
