<p>Is tonight the night that you take control of me? Tell me boy what's it really gonna be. Spending time for a while. Oh daddy come close. I'm straight feeling your style. I love the way you make me feel when you keep it real. When you're holding me. When your'e spooning me. Oh you look sexy when you're touching me.</p>

<p>When you're bumping me gently sitting here waiting in my Vicky's in the mirror imaging you're with me. Petit Cheri and I'm smelling real nice and Moet cold chillin' on ice coming over half past ten and I'm wondering if I'm really gonna let him in give in give it up let it go or tell him no.</p>
<p>Should I give him some? Maybe? Is this the night for fun? Maybe?</p>
